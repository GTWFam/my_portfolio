            My name is Hoang, but english-speaking people call me Bill. My
            origin lies in Hanoi, Vietnam. Both of my parents are Vietnamese,
            but in 1994 they decided to move to Russia (that is also the year
            when my older sister was born). Six years later in a Moscow hospital
            I was brought to life and started my adventurous life journey.
            Growing up I was taught Vietnamese by my parents and Russian ny growing
            up in the country. Then I started learning English in school as it was the
            requirement. As a result, I am a junior at Worcester Polytechnic
            Institute in the United States where I started pursuing Computer
            Science major.

            One year after high school graduation my friend and I were talking 
            about how difficult for us was to apply for colleges and how much stress
            it brought us. Then, we created a YouTube channel to help other students
            with a huge struggle of what to do after high school. In this project
            I am the main video editer and a design creater.
